# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purspose
This is a password generator to help you create a password. In order to use this password generator, in the you will be asked a few questions in the beginning. First, you should provide a whole number that is between 8-128 which will be your password length. Then you can choose whether or not you want to include numbers, lower case, upper case and special characters. If you do not choose an option, you will be asked to start from the beginning and enter a number again.

## Future Improvements
This password generator goes through a few loops in a specific to create a password string. This password string could be hacked easily. Although, the shuffule() function shuffles the array elements in the finalPassword, finding a new way that randomly goes through the loops will generate stronger password.
